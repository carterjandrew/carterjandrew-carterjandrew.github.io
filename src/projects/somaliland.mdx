During the fall of 2024 I joined an expidition to Somaliland with the NYAGI project non-profit. Our goal was to teach 5 members of the Edna Adan Hostpital how to use butterfly probe for prenadal care.

# Background on NYAGI
NYAGI is a foundation dedicated to saving mothers lives. To learn more about my other work with them, look [here](/projects/nyagi).

# Accomplishments
Our team worked with two doctors:
## Dr. Amal
## Dr. Asha

Along with two medical students:
## Samira
## Ridwan


To bring them to competency in two areas:

## Competency in prenadal ultrasound
During our four days working with the team we used our mornings to scan mothers in the hospital and surrouding clinics. This allowed our trainees to work in a real world enviroment and get feedback from our sonographers. This essential expirience dramatically increased the confidence and abilities of the trainees.

These mornings were by far the most memorable and successful part of our trip. Not only did we get to provide free care for mothers but we saw the effects of our teaching in a dramatic way. Each day our patients were able to nearly double the amount of patients they were able to scan. As the amount of supervision they needed lowered we set up more stations and complete scans quicker.  

## Competency in teaching prenadal ultrasound
The butterfly software provides a cloud service for uploading studies. Combined with this our trainees were taught and practised with a method for crutiqeing scans, labeling, and notes. These methods will allow us to track all scans and studies done by practicioners in our system, ensuring we will be able to audit and verify the quality of everyone. 

# Continuation
Our trainees will be working with 2 midwives from 3 clinics in the Hargesia district to train. From each, one of the two candidates will be selected as a approved practicioner and trainer of the NYAGI methods. 

Through our online systems we will be monitoring and assisting with the training program.

# My Contributions
My main role during the trip was to provide technical support for the devices, this consisted of fixing issues that occured with the butterfly probes and the iPads. Through this I've been able to clarify the technical challanges of using our tools in remote clinics. Using the [x-nav](/projects/xnav) software I'll be able to
