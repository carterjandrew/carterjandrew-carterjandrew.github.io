# My work with NYAGI

[NYAGI](https://nyagi.org) is a non-profit dedicated to helping save mothers lives through ultrasound in medically underserved areas. During my time I've worked in the Republic of Somaliland, on a ultrasound computer vision app, and built a software for constructing lecture content for trainers. All my contributions are detailed below.
